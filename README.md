# TAPL

Implementations of the languages in Pierce's [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) in Rust. Based on [the official implementations in Ocaml](https://github.com/mspertus/TAPL).

Each language comes with a simple REPL with tab completion for keywords. But reading source codes from a file is not yet supported.
